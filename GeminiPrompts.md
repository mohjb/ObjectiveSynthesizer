# User Prompts (Chronological Order)
 * If the user interface of Star Trek computer panels or JavaScript classes for components and containers then what would be the subclasses of components of containers in terms of comprehensively covering all the subclasses of the Star Trek computer panels UI
 * What is the best approach for a plan to implement this library / framework of components and containers
 * I like the plan as a whole, but as for phase 1 , The dependency should be restricted to only be core js( maybe through js use html and css )
   I'll need you to write down the actual work for each phase, but one phase at a time , so that I can understand the implementation and provide feedback
 * Sounds good , I'll need it in a canvas
   Maybe a new phase of the project (at the end) , an editor of a ui , and the editor is based on the same classes
 * So just give me a numbered bullet points of the phases ( and hierarchy of nested levels) , so that we can more objectively zoom to the meant discussion and professionally add material to the plan and linking which aspects are intended
 * So I'll also need a phase 6 for editing Cartesian coordinates and layouts, in a visually objective approach. Aiming at a scientific spirit and power and structure and awareness of the power of maths and elaborate models , with animated and interactive event driven approach of editing Cartesian coordinates and other units( other than the first 3 dimensions) and model constrains
 * Phase 6 will also provide a palette that goes into geometry and algebra ( although algebra ever so lightly) , and also a palette for computer graphical constructs
 * Phase 7 should go into fsm( rudimentary, but provide callbacks in terms of js functions) and data maps, classes and properties , and function( control flow and expressions) constructs
 * Phase 6 should be more aware of Cartesian coordinate systems, the x\y axises , and create multiple systems if needed, and with each new instance specifying the units types of x\y and domain\range constrains , and linkages between different system instances
 * Phase 8 should be for reprogrammable input output events
 * Phase 8 should be more aware of the device and operating system input output
 * Phase 7 should also include a sub model\components for inbound and outbound references and visual representation of references

Prompts with Summarized Responses
 * Prompt: If the user interface of Star Trek computer panels or JavaScript classes for components and containers then what would be the subclasses of components of containers in terms of comprehensively covering all the subclasses of the Star Trek computer panels UI
   Response: I outlined a comprehensive class hierarchy for a Star Trek UI. The top-level classes are StarfleetUI, Component, and Container. The subclasses for Container include BridgeMainView and Panel, which further branch into more specific panels like HelmPanel and MedicalPanel. The subclasses for Component include Button, Readout, and Control, with further specializations like ActionTriggerButton and GaugeReadout.
 * Prompt: What is the best approach for a plan to implement this library / framework of components and containers
   Response: I proposed a phased, agile-inspired implementation plan. The plan consists of four phases: Phase 1: Planning and Foundation, Phase 2: Core Components and Containers, Phase 3: Advanced Components and Features, and Phase 4: Documentation, Testing, and Deployment. I also discussed the recommended technology stack, emphasizing a component-based framework and CSS for styling.
 * Prompt: I like the plan as a whole, but as for phase 1 , The dependency should be restricted to only be core js( maybe through js use html and css )
   I'll need you to write down the actual work for each phase, but one phase at a time , so that I can understand the implementation and provide feedback
   Response: I refined the plan to focus on core JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, confirming that Web Components are the ideal technology for this approach. I then provided a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of the "actual work" for Phase 1: Planning and Foundation, including creating the project structure, defining a global theme with CSS variables, and implementing the StarfleetComponent and StarfleetContainer base classes.
 * Prompt: Sounds good , I'll need it in a canvas
   Maybe a new phase of the project (at the end) , an editor of a ui , and the editor is based on the same classes
   Response: I acknowledged the user's request and provided the full code for Phase 1 within a canvas. I also added a new conceptual phase, Phase 5: The Starfleet UI Editor, to the project plan, which would be built using the library's own components.
 * Prompt: So just give me a numbered bullet points of the phases ( and hierarchy of nested levels) , so that we can more objectively zoom to the meant discussion and professionally add material to the plan and linking which aspects are intended
   Response: I presented a formalized project plan with a numbered list of phases and a nested, bullet-point hierarchy of the component and container subclasses. This provided a clear roadmap for all subsequent discussions and modifications.
 * Prompt: So I'll also need a phase 6 for editing Cartesian coordinates and layouts, in a visually objective approach. Aiming at a scientific spirit and power and structure and awareness of the power of maths and elaborate models , with animated and interactive event driven approach of editing Cartesian coordinates and other units( other than the first 3 dimensions) and model constrains
   Response: I integrated a new phase, Phase 6: Cartesian & Multidimensional Editing, into the project plan. The new phase was defined to include a component for scientific modeling, animated and interactive coordinate editing, and the visualization of mathematical model constraints.
 * Prompt: Phase 6 will also provide a palette that goes into geometry and algebra ( although algebra ever so lightly) , and also a palette for computer graphical constructs
   Response: I updated the project plan to include these specific features within Phase 6. The new deliverables now specify a Geometry and Algebra palette and a Computer Graphical Constructs palette as part of the Cartesian editor.
 * Prompt: Phase 7 should go into fsm( rudimentary, but provide callbacks in terms of js functions) and data maps, classes and properties , and function( control flow and expressions) constructs
   Response: I added Phase 7: Programmatic & Logical Constructs to the plan. This phase was outlined to include components for a visual Finite State Machine editor, a data mapper for defining classes and properties, and a function editor for building control flow and expressions.
 * Prompt: Phase 6 should be more aware of Cartesian coordinate systems, the x\y axises , and create multiple systems if needed, and with each new instance specifying the units types of x\y and domain\range constrains , and linkages between different system instances
   Response: I refined the plan for Phase 6 to include more detailed requirements. The Cartesian editor was updated to support multiple independent coordinate systems, each with configurable axis labels, unit types, domain/range constraints, and linkages between instances. I then provided the full, updated code for Phase 2.
 * Prompt: Phase 8 should be for reprogrammable input output events
   Response: I added a new final phase, Phase 8: Reprogrammable I/O Events, to the plan. This phase was defined to include a visual "logic engine" for creating and remapping custom input and output event handlers.
 * Prompt: Phase 8 should be more aware of the device and operating system input output
   Response: I updated the plan for Phase 8 to specify that the I/O programmer component should be deeply aware of the device and operating system. The deliverables were expanded to include triggers from sources like keyboard presses, touch gestures, and system events, as well as output actions like audio and haptic feedback.
 * Prompt: Phase 7 should also include a sub model\components for inbound and outbound references and visual representation of references
   Response: I updated the plan for Phase 7 to include a new sub-model for inbound and outbound references within the objectivesynthesizer-data-mapper component. The plan specifies that these relationships should have a visual representation.
 * Prompt: In phase 6, an additional sub bullet point should be included for, layout guidelines ( vertical and horizontal lines on the layout for snapping coordinate systems for drag-and-drop) that also binds the dropped shapes with the guidelines, bound in both the storage and in terms of events.
   Response: I updated the plan for Phase 6 with the new requirement for a layout guidelines system. This system will feature visual snapping guides for drag-and-drop operations, with the binding information stored and communicated via events.
 * Prompt: I want to create a public repo on a GitHub-like website and I need a new name for the project, a name that has something like "scientific" or "coordinate system"
   Response: I provided three name suggestions: StellarCartesian, ScientificLCARS, and AstroGrid, all of which incorporated the requested scientific and coordinate system themes.
 * Prompt: Let's try other names, something with: scientific, coordinate system, geometric, programmable , logic, dimensions, model,
   Response: I provided three new names based on the additional keywords: Axiom Canvas, VectorSynth, and Logic Modeler.
 * Prompt: Logical and programmable modeling UI synthesizer,
   Give me a smart and catchy abbreviation for it
   Response: I provided a few abbreviations based on the long project name, including LPMS, L.P.S., and LP-Synth, and discussed their strengths.
 * Prompt: What do you think about logics synthesizer
   Response: I endorsed Logics Synthesizer as a strong, concise, and professional name that accurately captures the project's essence.
 * Prompt: Thank you,
   What about: logical ui synthesizer (LUIS)
   Or logical objective communications synthesizer ( LOCoS )
   Response: I provided a brief analysis of both name options, highlighting the strengths of Logical UI Synthesizer (LUIS) and Logical Objective Communications Synthesizer (LOCoS). I noted that LOCoS had a more specific, sci-fi feel that aligned well with the project's themes. The user then selected LOCoS as the preferred name, which was later changed to Objective Synthesizer.
